For a React.js developer with 8 years of experience, the questions during an interview or discussion will likely focus on deeper concepts and advanced topics. Here's a list of commonly asked questions that may be relevant for someone at that level:

### 1. **Advanced React Concepts**
   - How does React’s reconciliation algorithm (Fiber) work?
   - Can you explain the React component lifecycle in-depth? How does it differ between class and functional components?
   - How does React’s `useEffect` hook work, and how do you manage side effects in functional components?
   - What is the purpose of `React.memo`, and how does it work to optimize performance?
   - Can you explain the concept of "render props" and how it differs from "higher-order components" (HOCs)?
   - How does React’s Context API work, and when would you use it over Redux or other state management libraries?
   - What are the performance implications of using inline functions and object literals inside the JSX?

### 2. **State Management**
   - How do you handle global state in React applications? What is your experience with Redux or Zustand? Can you compare them?
   - What is the difference between local state, global state, and derived state in React? How do you manage them efficiently?
   - Can you explain the concept of `useReducer` and when to use it over `useState`?
   - How do you handle asynchronous actions in state management (e.g., with Redux middleware like `redux-thunk` or `redux-saga`)?

### 3. **Performance Optimization**
   - How do you optimize the performance of a React application?
   - Can you explain "code splitting" and "lazy loading" in React? How would you implement it in a large-scale app?
   - What are some common performance bottlenecks in React apps, and how do you address them (e.g., avoiding unnecessary re-renders)?
   - How does React's `shouldComponentUpdate` (or `React.memo` for functional components) work for performance optimization?
   - What are the best practices for handling large lists and rendering performance issues in React?

### 4. **Testing in React**
   - What is your approach to testing React components? Can you explain the difference between unit, integration, and end-to-end testing?
   - How do you test React hooks, particularly `useEffect` and `useState`?
   - What libraries do you prefer for testing React (e.g., Jest, React Testing Library, Enzyme) and why?
   - How do you handle mocking and stubbing in React testing?

### 5. **React Router & Navigation**
   - How does React Router work? Can you explain the difference between `BrowserRouter` and `HashRouter`?
   - How would you handle protected routes in React, and how can you implement route guards or authentication checks?
   - How do you pass props to components in a route? Can you explain `useParams` and `useHistory` hooks?

### 6. **TypeScript with React**
   - How do you integrate TypeScript with React? Can you explain some of the challenges you've faced?
   - What are the benefits and trade-offs of using TypeScript in React projects?
   - How do you type React components, hooks, and context API efficiently in TypeScript?

### 7. **React Native (if applicable)**
   - If you have React Native experience, how does React Native differ from React for the web?
   - How do you optimize performance and deal with platform-specific issues in React Native?

### 8. **Hooks and Functional Components**
   - What are the key differences between `useState` and `useReducer` in terms of state management?
   - Can you explain the rules of hooks and why they are important?
   - How do you manage multiple side effects in a single component with `useEffect`?
   - Can you explain how you would implement custom hooks for reusability and encapsulation?

### 9. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG)**
   - What is the difference between SSR, SSG, and Client-Side Rendering (CSR)? When would you use each approach in a React application?
   - Have you worked with frameworks like Next.js for SSR or static site generation? Can you explain its benefits?
   - How does React hydrate when rendering on the server and how do you manage hydration errors?

### 10. **Code Architecture and Design Patterns**
   - What design patterns have you used in React applications (e.g., component composition, container/presentational patterns, hooks)?
   - How do you manage complex state interactions in large applications, and how do you ensure scalability and maintainability of the app’s architecture?
   - What is the strategy for organizing large codebases and component hierarchies in React?
   - How do you handle the separation of concerns and reusability in React components?

### 11. **Build Tools and Ecosystem**
   - How do you manage and configure build tools (Webpack, Babel, etc.) in a React project?
   - Can you explain the role of React DevTools in debugging and optimizing React applications?
   - How do you handle cross-browser compatibility and feature detection in React?

### 12. **Real-World Application Questions**
   - Can you describe a complex React project you’ve worked on? What were the main challenges and how did you address them?
   - How do you handle errors and exceptions in React applications? What’s your approach to implementing error boundaries?
   - Have you worked with React in a micro-frontend architecture? How did you handle communication between different React micro-frontends?

These questions test not only your depth of understanding but also your ability to apply React in real-world, complex situations. With 8 years of experience, interviewers would expect you to provide detailed, practical examples demonstrating your expertise and problem-solving capabilities.
